# Chests (card game)
A simple game of chests.

The goal is to collect groups of 4 cards (chests) with the same rank by stealing cards from other players. The player who has the most chests is the winner.
## Rules
+ Each player is dealt 5 cards from the deck.

+ Players take turns asking their opponents if they have cards of a specific rank (e.g., aces, tens, queens, etc.).

+ If the opponent confirms having the requested cards, they must hand them over to the player asking. The player who receives the cards continues asking questions.

+ If the answer is negative, the player must draw one card from the deck, and their turn ends, passing to their opponent.

+ When a player collects all 4 cards of the same rank (a «chest»), they lay them down, removing them from their hand
#### Notes 
The Comp mode has been tested fairly well, shouldn't be any issues. The multiplayer mode has been tested less throughly. Be sure to report any bugs you find if you wish to. Thank you!
